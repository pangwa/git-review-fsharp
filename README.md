# Project Objective

Construct a native implementation of [git-review](https://opendev.org/opendev/git-review/src/branch/master/git_review), which does not require any additional dependencies to be installed, as a standalone executable.


## Better Unicode support

The current version of `git-review` often encounters encoding errors when used on terminals that are not encoded in utf-8. We should bring a better unicode support.
